## 🧪 Test Your Authentication

### 1. **Login Flow**
```bash
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. You'll be redirected to /login
3. Try logging in (if you have an account)
```

### 2. **Registration Flow**
```bash
1. Click "Sign up" on login page
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: testpassword123
3. Submit the form
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ If email verification is **disabled**: Instant redirect to `/workspace`
- ⚠️ If email verification is **enabled**: See helpful error message

### 3. **Protected Routes**
```bash
# Try accessing dashboard without auth
1. Open incognito window
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/workspace
3. Should redirect to /login ✅
```
