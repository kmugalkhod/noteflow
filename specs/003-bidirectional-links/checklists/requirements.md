# Specification Quality Checklist: Bi-Directional Links

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All quality checks passed!**

### Content Quality Analysis
- Specification contains no framework-specific details (no mention of React, Convex implementation, etc.)
- Focus is entirely on user value ("users can create links," "knowledge discovery," "visual exploration")
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Analysis
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements use reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions)
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- 11 success criteria all include specific metrics (time: "under 5 seconds," "100ms," percentages: "80%," "100% accuracy")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Users can create a link in under 5 seconds" not "API responds in 200ms")
- 5 user stories each have 4-6 acceptance scenarios covering main and edge cases
- 8 edge cases identified covering special characters, circular refs, deletions, performance limits
- Scope clearly defines 10 in-scope items and 9 out-of-scope items
- 6 dependencies and 6 assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Analysis
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User stories cover full journey from P1 (foundational linking) through P5 (maintenance)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- No leakage of implementation details (database schemas, API endpoints, component names)

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No revisions needed.
