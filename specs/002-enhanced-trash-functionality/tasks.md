# Tasks: Enhanced Trash Functionality

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/memory/002-enhanced-trash-functionality/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (different files)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1, but works best with US1 for complete UX
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, but builds on US1/US2 UI
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from all others
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from all others
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1/US2 patterns but independent

### Within Each User Story

- All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Tasks without [P] may have minor dependencies within the story
- Backend mutations generally come before UI integration
- Components before integration into views

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] (T005-T007) can run in parallel after T004
- Once Foundational completes, ALL user story tasks can run in parallel:
  - US1: T008-T010, T011-T012 can be done simultaneously (backend + frontend)
  - US2: T017-T018, T019-T021 can be done simultaneously (components + backend)
  - US3: T025-T030 can all be done simultaneously (6 parallel tasks)
  - US4: T037-T040 can all be done simultaneously (4 parallel tasks)
  - US5: T048-T050 can be done simultaneously (3 parallel tasks)
  - US6: T056-T059 can be done simultaneously (4 parallel tasks)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] (T066-T072, T074-T076) can run in parallel after T073

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Auto-Expiration)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch all US1 tasks together:
Task: "Create trash constants file with retention period"
Task: "Implement expiration calculation helpers"
Task: "Create ExpirationBadge component"
Task: "Create scheduled cleanup mutation"
Task: "Create cron job configuration"

# These 5 tasks work on different files and can be completed in parallel
# Then integrate together in remaining tasks (T013-T016)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Bulk Operations)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch all US3 setup tasks:
Task: "Create useBulkSelect hook"
Task: "Create BulkActionsToolbar component"
Task: "Create EmptyTrashDialog component"
Task: "Implement bulkRestoreNotes mutation"
Task: "Implement bulkPermanentDeleteNotes mutation"
Task: "Implement emptyTrash mutation"

# These 6 tasks work on different files and can be completed in parallel
# Then integrate into TrashView and TrashNoteCard (T031-T036)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T007) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Auto-Expiration (T008-T016)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Original Location (T017-T024)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test auto-expiration and smart restore independently
6. Demo the enhanced trash before proceeding to P2/P3 features

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready ‚úÖ
2. Add User Story 1 (Auto-Expiration) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (MVP with auto-cleanup!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Original Location) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Smart restore!)
4. Add User Story 3 (Bulk Operations) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Efficient management!)
5. Add User Story 4 (Filters/Search) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Easy navigation!)
6. Add User Story 5 (Undo Toast) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Mistake prevention!)
7. Add User Story 6 (Folder Soft-Delete) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Complete trash system!)
8. Polish phase ‚Üí Final refinements

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Auto-Expiration) - 9 tasks
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Original Location) - 8 tasks
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Bulk Operations) - 12 tasks
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Filters/Search) - 11 tasks
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Undo Toast) - 8 tasks
   - Developer F: User Story 6 (Folder Soft-Delete) - 10 tasks
3. All stories integrate independently without conflicts

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and validatable
- Backend mutations typically come before UI integration
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **No tests required**: Functional validation is sufficient for trash enhancements
- **Schema changes are critical**: Must deploy T004-T007 before any user story work
- **Scheduled jobs**: Test cleanup job in development before production
- **Audit logging**: Optional but recommended for production monitoring

---

- ‚úÖ Trash auto-cleans after 30 days (zero manual intervention)
- ‚úÖ Notes restore to original folders (95%+ success rate)

## Migration & Deployment Notes

### Schema Migration (Foundational Phase)

- New fields are optional, so no data migration needed
- Existing trash notes will work without `deletedFromFolderId` (restore to root)
- Deploy schema changes first, then application code

### Scheduled Job Deployment

- Test cleanup job thoroughly in development
- Start with dry-run mode (logging only) in production
- Monitor first week, then enable actual deletion
- Set up alerts for job failures

### Feature Flags (Optional)

Consider feature flags for:
- Scheduled cleanup (enable after monitoring)
- Folder soft-delete (opt-in initially)
- Bulk operations (limit to admins first)

### Rollback Plan

- Schema changes are additive (safe to rollback code)
- Disable scheduled job if issues detected
- Monitor audit logs for unexpected deletions
