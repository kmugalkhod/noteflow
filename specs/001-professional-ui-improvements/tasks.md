# Tasks: Professional UI Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/memory/001-professional-ui-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md

**Tests**: Not required for UI improvements

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and validation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (independent files)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1/US2/US3

### Within Each User Story

- All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Tasks without [P] may have minor dependencies but can generally run in any order within the story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] (T005-T006) can run in parallel after T004
- Once Foundational completes, ALL user story tasks can run in parallel:
  - US1: All T007-T014 can be done simultaneously (8 parallel tasks)
  - US2: All T015-T021 can be done simultaneously (7 parallel tasks)
  - US3: All T023-T029 can be done after T022 (7 parallel tasks)
  - US4: All T030-T037 can be done simultaneously (8 parallel tasks)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] (T038-T042, T044-T045) can run in parallel after T043

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Animations)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch all US1 tasks together:
Task: "Add smooth hover transitions to FolderTreeItem"
Task: "Add selection animation to folder items"
Task: "Add hover and selection animations to NoteListItem"
Task: "Enhance save indicator animation"
Task: "Add fade transition on note switch"
Task: "Add smooth transitions to toolbar buttons"
Task: "Add slide-in animation to slash menu"
Task: "Add subtle scale animation to formatting toolbar"

# All 8 tasks work on different files and can be completed in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Animations (T007-T014)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all animations independently
5. Demo the smooth interactions before proceeding

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready ‚úÖ
2. Add User Story 1 (Animations) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (MVP with smooth animations!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Typography) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Better readability!)
4. Add User Story 3 (Empty States) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Polished feedback!)
5. Add User Story 4 (Spacing) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Demo (Professional layout!)
6. Polish phase ‚Üí Final refinements

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Animations) - 8 parallel tasks
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Typography) - 7 parallel tasks
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Empty States) - 8 parallel tasks
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Spacing) - 8 parallel tasks
3. All stories integrate independently without conflicts

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and validatable
- Test animations in both light and dark modes
- Verify accessibility of all visual changes
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **No tests required**: Visual validation is sufficient for UI improvements
- **Cross-browser**: Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- **Responsive**: Validate on desktop, tablet, mobile

---

## Success Metrics

After implementing all user stories:

- ‚úÖ Animations feel smooth and professional (60fps)
- ‚úÖ Typography hierarchy is clear and readable
- ‚úÖ Empty states are inviting and helpful
- ‚úÖ Spacing feels balanced and not cramped
- ‚úÖ Dark mode is as polished as light mode
- ‚úÖ Accessible to keyboard and screen reader users
- ‚úÖ Performance remains excellent (no janky animations)
- ‚úÖ User feedback is positive on "feel" of the app
