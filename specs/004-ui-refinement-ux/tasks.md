# Tasks: UI/UX Refinement & Polish

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-ui-refinement-ux/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì)

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - tests are optional and excluded from this task list

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application using Next.js App Router:
- **App Routes**: `app/`
- **Feature Modules**: `modules/`
- **Shared Components**: `components/ui/`
- **Shared Utilities**: `modules/shared/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create foundational animation and UX utilities that all user stories depend on

- [ ] T001 Create animation utilities directory at modules/shared/hooks/
- [ ] T002 Create animation library directory at modules/shared/lib/
- [ ] T003 Create animation store directory at modules/shared/stores/
- [ ] T004 [P] Copy type definitions from contracts/ to project (animation-types.ts, loading-types.ts, toast-types.ts)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core animation infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T010) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T022)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T023-T034)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both P1 stories independently
6. Demo smooth interactions, animations, and feedback

At this point, you have a highly polished MVP with:
- Immediate visual feedback for all interactions
- Smooth transitions for modals, dropdowns, and state changes
- Contextual toast notifications
- GPU-accelerated animations with proper easing

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Core animation infrastructure ready
2. Add P1 Stories (Phases 3-4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add P2 Stories (Phases 5-7) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add P3 Stories (Phases 8-9) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Polish (Phase 10) ‚Üí Final optimization and validation

Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done, split work:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Visual Feedback)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Transitions)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Loading States)
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Keyboard Nav)
3. After P1 stories (US1, US2) complete: Validate and deploy MVP
4. Continue with P2 and P3 stories in parallel

---

## Success Metrics (Track Throughout Implementation)

- **SC-001**: 90% of user interactions show visual feedback within 100ms
- **SC-002**: Zero layout shifts with CLS score < 0.1
- **SC-003**: All animations maintain minimum 30fps (target 60fps)
- **SC-004**: 100% of interactive elements keyboard-accessible
- **SC-005**: User satisfaction for "interface smoothness" increases 30%+
- **SC-006**: Task completion time reduces 15-20% due to clearer affordances
- **SC-007**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (focus states, keyboard nav)
- **SC-008**: 90%+ users can identify visual hierarchy without guidance

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/components, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1-US7) for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of parallel tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Prioritize P1 stories (US1, US2) for MVP - they provide maximum impact
- Test with prefers-reduced-motion throughout development
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to monitor frame rates
- Validate accessibility with Lighthouse and axe DevTools

**Total Tasks**: 100 tasks across 10 phases (7 user stories + setup + foundation + polish)

**Estimated Timeline**:
- MVP (Phases 1-4): 3-5 days (P1 stories only)
- Full Feature (All Phases): 7-10 days
- With parallel team: 5-7 days total
